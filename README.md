What am I even doing anymore man

## Setup
1. Make sure you have [the most recent version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) downloaded.
2. Clone or download and extract the repository.
3. Open it in an IDE with a termianl of your choice (like VSC).
4. Run `pip install pillow`. This is the Python library required to display images.
5. Run `python shrimpdetectionsoftware.py` to run the code. If a window appears with text and buttons - congrats! You did everything right.
